De Parfum Full-Stack Web App

It is a useful web application for those store owners who want to share their products online in order to attract customers to their stores. This web app allows that only administrators can manage the products after logging in, then these products will be displayed on another page that consumers can access.

This web app integrates Reactjs to build the front-end, Spring Tool boot to build the back-end, and  RESTful API with Axios (HTTP library) to display information in a view format. Moreover, Bootstrap was used as a tool to design the web app, MySQL to manage the database, and Postman to test the API end-point.

Finally, this is my first time implementing Spring Boot and Reactjs together to build a web app, so suggestions that help me to improve my project are welcomed. 


Technologies Used:


Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, Reactjs, Bootstrap, Axios library


Backend: MySQL, Springboot, Postman. 

APIs: http://localhost:8081/api/v1/products
